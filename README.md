Cobb's Quay Weather
===================

**Please note that as of November 2016, Cobbs Quay's weather station is no longer online. As such this script no longer works and is not being maintained.**

Cobb's Quay in Poole Harbour has a [Flash-only front-end](http://www.cobbs-quay-weather.co.uk/) to its weather station. My "Cobb's Quay Weather" page grabs the data files behind the Flash, and displays the important bits with minimal formatting, e.g. for mobile browsers.

Made for a friend of mine who couldn't get the Flash interface to work from his phone.
