Cobb's Quay Weather
===================

Cobb's Quay in Poole Harbour has a [Flash-only front-end](http://www.cobbs-quay-weather.co.uk/) to its weather station. My "Cobb's Quay Weather" page grabs the data files behind the Flash, and displays the important bits with minimal formatting, e.g. for mobile browsers.

Made for a friend of mine who couldn't get the Flash interface to work from his phone.

You can see the current weather at Cobb's Quay by visiting [https://files.ianrenton.com/weather/cobbs.php](https://files.ianrenton.com/weather/cobbs.php). (This is quite frequently broken because the source data is, rather than the script itself)
