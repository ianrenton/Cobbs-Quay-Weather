Cobb's Quay Weather
===================

Cobb's Quay in Poole Harbour has a [crappy Flash-only front-end](http://www.cobbs-quay-weather.co.uk/) to its weather station. My "Cobb's Quay Weather" page grabs the data files behind the Flash, and displays the important bits with minimal formatting, e.g. for mobile browsers.

Made for a friend of mine who couldn't get the Flash interface to work from his phone.
